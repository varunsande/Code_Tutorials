                    <p>Content placement is a key component in effective content management, which also includes 
                        repurposing, recycling and refining existing content to serve multiple objectives in 
                        parallel. For instance, a captivating press release or PR measure might easily be adapted 
                        to work well as a tweet, banner ad, or article in your newsletter, digital digest or e-magazine.

                        Adapting appealing content to fit in new formats is mission-critical to the success of your
                         messaging. We can help. Our team is skilled and experienced in using content to communicate, 
                         and in assisting companies to adjust their media mix to reach their target audiences.

                <br>
                   <p>Targeted content placement is key  its what makes you discoverable, especially if its online.
                     There are many ways to do this. Successful companies employ a multimodal approach, using a balanced 
                     media mix and variety of formats to deliver their message When considering your content placement, 
                     its helpful to think about your influence over your media mix. One way of classifying the different 
                     channels is by thinking of them as owned, paid and earned media. Here is a quick overview of what 
                     those mean</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Certification is the provision by an independent body of written assurance (a certificate) that the
                         product, service or system in question meets specific requirements. It is the formal attestation
                          or confirmation of certain characteristics of an object, person, or organization. This confirmation
                           is often, but not always, provided by some form of external review, education, assessment, or 
                           audit. Accreditation is a specific organization's process of certification. According to the U.S.
                            National Council on Measurement in Education, a certification test is a credentialing test used 
                            to determine whether individuals are knowledgeable enough in a given occupational area to be labeled
                             "competent to practice" in that area.
                    </p>
                    
                <br>
                <p>For software testing, the certifications can be grouped into exam-based and education-based. For exam-based 
                    certifications the candidate must pass an exam, which can also be learned by self-study. For example, for 
                    International Software Testing Qualifications Board Certified Tester by the International Software Testing 
                    Qualifications Board or Certified Software Tester by QAI or Certified Software Quality Engineer by 
                    American Society for Quality. Education-based certifications are the instructor-led sessions, where each 
                    course has to be passed. The Certified Software Test Professional (CSTP), the Certified Agile Software 
                    Test Professional (CASTP), the Certified Test Manager (CTM) and other certifications by Institute for 
                    Software Testing are such examples. It is common for people who require certifications to undergo
                     paid structured learning to help them achieve their goals.
